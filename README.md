# LAST (Linear Allocation Set Theoy)

## Data Level

- Regular Finite
- Finite
    ```
    fc = {e1, e2}
    ```
- Infinite
    ```
    ic1d = {e1, e2, ...}
    ```
- 2-D Infinite
    ```
    ic2d = {*ic1d1, ic1d2, ...}
        ic1d1 = {...}
        ic1d2 = {...}

## Axioms

### Linear Allocation

For any array of data, you must be able to reach next element within finite and determinable distance.
